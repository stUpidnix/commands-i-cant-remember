# commands-i-cant-remember

This repo is a collection of unix/linux/osx-cli/whatevs commands that i use a lot that I have trouble remembering.

I'm creating this repo to help me:
1) learn and use github
2) learn and use git
3) learn and use the commands placed here since it bothers me to look them up when i can't remember them and this should help with that.
4) be snarky for no reason

that's it for now. thanks for playing.
